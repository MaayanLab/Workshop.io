[LymeMIND](https://lymemind.org/) is designed to enable a systems medicine approach to identify novel biomarkers and new therapeutic opportunities. Through our network of collaborators, we are able to interrogate the complex biology of samples collected from Lyme-affected individuals using molecular profiling technologies and applying advanced statistical and machine learning approaches to move rapidly from “Big Data” to knowledge and improved understanding of the disease. LymeMIND is a part of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City and is made possible by generous support from the Cohen Lyme & Tickborne Disease Initiative.
