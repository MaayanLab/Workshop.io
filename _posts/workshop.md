Welcome to the Ma'ayan lab workshop series! Over the course of 8 workshops, we will be presenting a range of powerful and innovative tools that we have developed to help researchers in their analysis of biological data.
 
Each workshop will focus on a different tool or set of tools and provide an in-depth overview of its features, capabilities, and applications. We will also offer hands-on demonstrations of how to use these tools, and provide ample opportunities for participants to ask questions and engage with our team.

Whether you are a seasoned bioinformatics expert or a newcomer to the field, we believe that this workshop series will be a valuable resource for you. Our goal is to empower researchers with the knowledge and skills they need to extract meaningful insights from complex biological data, and we look forward to sharing our expertise with you.
