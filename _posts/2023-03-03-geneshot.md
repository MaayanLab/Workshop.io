[Geneshot](https://maayanlab.cloud/geneshot/help.html) is a search engine developed to illuminate this gap and promote attention to the under-studied genome. Through a simple web interface, Geneshot enables researchers to enter arbitrary search terms, to receive ranked lists of genes most relevant to the search terms. Returned ranked lists contain genes that have been previously published in association with the search terms, as well as ranked lists of genes predicted to be associated with the terms based on data integration from multiple omics sources.

The workshop will be led by [Alexander Lachmann, Ph.D.](https://profiles.mountsinai.org/alexander-lachmann), who is an assistant professor at Ma'ayan laboratory and developed geneshot.
