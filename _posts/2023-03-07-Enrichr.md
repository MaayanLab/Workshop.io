Are you interested in gaining deeper insights into the function and interactions of genes? Join us for our [Enrichr](https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/) and [Enrichr-KG](https://maayanlab.cloud/enrichr-kg) workshop and discover how this powerful tool can help you uncover new connections and pathways in your data.

**Enrichr** is a powerful bioinformatics tool that allows researchers to perform gene list enrichment analysis quickly and easily. Join us for our Enrichr workshop and learn how to make the most of this valuable tool. **Enrichr KG** (Knowledge Graph) is a cutting-edge extension of the Enrichr platform that allows for even deeper analysis of gene lists. In our Enrichr KG workshop, we'll explore the exciting new possibilities that this tool opens up for researchers.
