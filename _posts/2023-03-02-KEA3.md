Kinase Enrichment Analysis 3, [KEA3](https://maayanlab.cloud/kea3/) infers upstream kinases whose putative substrates are overrepresented in a user-inputted list of proteins or differentially phosphorylated proteins.

It can help researchers understand the functional roles of kinases in cellular processes. In our workshop, you'll discover how to use KEA3 to prioritize kinase targets and gain insights into kinase-mediated signaling pathways.

 *A ranked list of the top predicted kinases is displayed as networks, subnetworks, bar graphs and a clustergram*

The workshop is designed to provide overall information and demonstration on lncHUB2 for users at all levels of expertise. It will be led by **Giacomo Marino** who is a Bioinformatics Software Engineer at the Maâ€™ayan Laboratory.
