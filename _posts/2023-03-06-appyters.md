[Appyters](https://appyters.maayanlab.cloud/#/) are a collection of **web-based software applications that enable users to execute bioinformatics workflows without coding**. Each Appyter application introduces to a user a data entry form for uploading or fetching data, as well as for selecting options for various settings. Once the user presses Submit, the Appyter is executed in the cloud and the user is presented with a Jupyter Notebook report that contain the results. The report includes markdown text, interactive and static figures, and source code. Appyter users can share the link to the output report, as well as download the fully executable notebook for execution on other platforms.

The workshop is designed to provide overall information about Appyters for users at all levels of expertise. It will be led by **Daniel Clarke** who is a Data Science Analyst at the Maâ€™ayan Laboratory and the lead developer of Appyters.
